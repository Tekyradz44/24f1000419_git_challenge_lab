# Tic Tac Toe Game (Git Challenge Lab Submission)

🎮 A simple terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game in Python using modular code.

## 📁 Modules

- `main.py` – Game entry point
- `board.py` – Board display and update

python3 main.py

This is my version of Tic Tac Toe on the terminal. This is a project for my git hub workshop. I used VS code editor from a Mac. Also downloaded the desptop app of GIT HUB for easy pull requests and merging. I am also giving this project a MIT Licence. I did use LLM integrated in VS code to help with generating code and helping fix errors.
